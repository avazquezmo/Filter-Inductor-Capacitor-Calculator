Capacitance/Inductance Calculator for Filters
Personal project by Axel Vazquez

Description:
	This project contains a calculator to obtain capacitor and inductor values provided a specific 	 	cut-off frequency for first order frequency response circuits. The program computes the capaci        tor and inductor values using a text file with all the standard resistor values.

IMPORTANT:
	The text file containing resistor values must be in the same folder as the main code for it to 	       work properly.
